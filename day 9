We can, oh-oh
<br>Take it slow (这是 88rising)
<br>Take it slowly
<br>You gotta pace yourself, oh (oh, baby)
<br>It's me and you only
<br>I don't want nobody else (no, no, baby)
<br>But you gotta take it easy
<br>Slow the pace, ain't a race, woah
<br>I'm here all night for love, that's right
<br>When you please me, pump the brakes
<br>You can take your sweet time
<br>Ease your mind and remember
<br>When you push up on me, oh, oh, oh (oh, oh)
<br>Take it slow for me, daddy, go slow (go slow)
<br>You know I like it when you taking control (control)
<br>Take it slow for me, daddy, go slow (go slow)
<br>Slow it down, down, down (ooh-ooh-ooh)
<br>When you put it down, down, down (when I put it down, girl, oh)
<br>Ain't no rush (ain't no rush)
<br>Only us, skin to skin, baby
<br>Now let's pretend, baby (let's start slower)
<br>That we're doing this for the first time
<br>When we were friends, baby
<br>Remember then, baby (let's start slower)
<br>Said, "Take your time but make it nasty"
<br>Girl, I'll do anything you ask me
<br>You set the pace, the way you tease me
<br>Then slow it down until it's nice and easy
<br>Slow the pace, ain't a race, woah
<br>I'm here all night for love, that's right
<br>When you please me, pump the brakes
<br>You can take your sweet time
<br>Ease your mind and remember
<br>When you push up on me, oh, oh, oh (oh, oh)
<br>Take it slow for me, baby, go slow
<br>You know I like it when you taking control
<br>Take it slow for me, baby, go slow
<br>Slow it down, down, down
<br>When you put it down, down, down
<br>We can slow it down
<br>Oh, oh, we make this night a slow ride
<br>Ooh, ooh, passionate vibes, what you like
<br>You and I don't need no lights
<br>When that pressure's applied
<br>When that pressure's applied, you just
<br>Push up on me, oh, oh, oh (oh, oh)
<br>Take it slow, oh, oh, go slow (go slow)
<br>You know I like it when you, oh, oh, oh (oh, oh)
<br>Take it slow for me, daddy, go slow (go slow)
<br>Slow it down, down, down (ooh-ooh-ooh)
<br>When you put it down, down, down (down, oh)
